            Owe Dam is located in the forest area of Owe Village (also Owe Camp) in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai. It is unofficially one of the best picnic locations in Kharghar, though in an isolated spot nestled between the Kharghar Hills and Owe Hills.
            For those who are unaware and have heard the name “Owe” for the first time; Owe is a village in Owe Camp area, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai.
            The Owe Dam lies in the interiors, towards the forest area of Kharghar (Owe) Hills near Gholwadi village, and is constructed on a holding point or Owe lake, as people call it, which is located right in the centre of the hills that cover the water body like a fence.
            For first timers, the Owe Dam is not a huge dam or an exploited picnic spot like Pandavkada (Kharghar) Waterfalls (which is prohibited) or the driving range waterfalls (which is highly crowded and exploited).
            The aloofness and calmness of the Owe Dam area makes it the best of the lot and it is the ideal choice for those who like to enjoy the company of nature alone, and not amid reckless and unconcerned frolickers.

        <p style="padding:20px">
          The pump house structure at Owe Dam is a popular attraction
          Well, Owe Dam is on a lake which is calm and serene. So you can sit down and simply ponder over things while watching the calm water body.
          The serene, pollution free environment of the Owe Dam area (as compared to other parts of Kharghar, especially sectors 34, 35, 35 till the Taloja area, which are polluted owing to the pollution by factories in the Taloja MIDC) makes it an ideal location to indulge in some yoga or meditation routine.
          Having a small picnic of sorts, with family or friends, which involves snacks and treats can also be a great thing to do (provided you don’t litter around).
          For those who like to simply jump and splash in water, the Owe Dam is a safe water body unless you act irresponsibly.
